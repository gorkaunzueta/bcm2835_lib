This repository contains a bcm2835 library (bcm2835_lib), which is a framework component of the Core Flight System.

This bcm2835 library includes the corresponding functions and directions in order to be able to acces the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi. 

This library has been tested on a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B+. Different functions to access the GPIO are defined, as well as functions to easily use SPI and I2C communications.

You can find the cFS software for which this library has been designed at: https://github.com/nasa/cFS
